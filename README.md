# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊✌️🖐️ by @anabeeella

## 📖 Introduction:

Welcome to my enhanced Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This project originated from a freeCodeCamp(\*) course, and I've added several new styles to improve the user experience and interface.

## ✌️ Project Overview:

This mini-game allows users to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors against the computer. With a focus on improving the visual appeal and user interaction, this project demonstrates how thoughtful design can enhance a classic game's enjoyment.

## ✨ Creation Process:

### Planning:

- **Concept:** The initial idea was to build upon the Rock, Paper, Scissors game created during the freeCodeCamp course by enhancing the user interface and experience.
- **Features:** Identified opportunities to streamline the UI and make the game more visually appealing and intuitive.

### Design and Development:

#### Design Improvements:

- **Simplified UI:** Removed the title and game rules. Given the universal familiarity with the game, the rules were deemed redundant. Additionally, the dropdown component for the rules required an extra click, slowing down the process. The only remaining rule is the winning condition (first to 3 points).

- **Visual Enhancements:** Replaced text options with icons for user selections, making the game more visual. Both the user and computer selections are now displayed prominently with images, with text serving as a complement.

#### Development:

- **HTML:** Modified the structure to accommodate new visual elements and simplified the interface.
- **CSS:** Enhanced the styling to improve visual appeal and responsiveness. Used predefined colors (stored in variables) for round result notifications.
- **JavaScript:** Updated the logic to manipulate DOM elements, adding new attributes for changing images based on user selection and random computer assignments.

#### Deployment:

Deployed the game to a web server, making it accessible for everyone to play.

## 🚀 Next steps:

- Add a delay between selection and result display.
- Implement hand movement animations during the waiting period.
- Include sound effects for paper, metal, or rock based on the round winner.
- Add victory and defeat sounds.
- Introduce a confetti animation when the user wins.

## 👩🏽‍💻 Conclusion:

This enhanced Rock, Paper, Scissors game demonstrates how thoughtful design and user experience improvements can make a classic game more engaging.  [Check out the live game here](https://rock-paper-scissors-by-anabeeella.netlify.app/). Enjoy playing and feel free to contribute!
